## Hook and Rubric Documents

The hook document outlining the case study is the file labeled [hook-CS.pdf](hook-CS.pdf). The rubric [rubric-CS.pdf](rubric-CS.pdf) outlines the formatting, submission requirements, and final deliverables for this assignment. Both documents should be referenced continously throughout your completion of the case study to guarantee success on the assignment.


## Data and Resources

The review data can be obtained from Kaggle linked [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedbakhet/amazon-books-reviews). Note that the sourced data will come in two csv files, with a primary key of `title` in books.csv linking each book to a specific review with foreign key `book_title` in reviews.csv. Resources suggested for project replication can be found as PDFs in [Resources](Resources) and also linked in [resources.txt](Resources/resources.txt), as well as the original project repository.
